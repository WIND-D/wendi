  <h1 class="center">Research Scope - <br>It is no logner just a radio experience</h1>
  <p class="text">
      Whether it’s an interview on-air, a news story that caught someone’s eye on our website, an episode of a podcast with critical thinking, or a post on social media, public radio is no longer just a voice people listen to during drive time on the car radio. Every touch WBUR has with our audience contributes to our audience’s experience, and impacts how they relate to our station.

      Through <a href="http://publicradiobizlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WBUR-Lets-Talk-Survey-Opportunity-Report.pdf">previous BizLab research</a>, we know that our listeners discover us through multiple scenarios and have kept listening to us for different reasons. Some people formed the habit of listening to WBUR when they were a child in the backseats of cars when their parents tuned into WBUR (or another local NPR station) during family drives. Other people started listening to WBUR while taking a college course, as part of a course assignment. Others found WBUR through a colleague’s or friend’s recommendation. In some cases, people moved to Boston and transferred their listening from another city’s NPR station to WBUR. And others did not have an affinity for public radio at all, but were seeking quality journalism and captivating programs, and found WBUR by surfing the radio dial or browsing podcast recommendations, and became a loyal listener because of the quality content WBUR produces.
      
      Our survey and metrics show that our audience is consuming our content on multiple platforms. Between our live stream, podcasts, and on-demand programs, people who used to listen by physical radios are migrating to digital platforms, leveraging the meaning of “experience” for public radio: people interact with our station across platforms and medium.
      
      Behind all of these many paths that lead people to WBUR, and the many forms of engagement with WBUR, we want to know if there are fundamentally different motivations amongst our listeners in why they listen, and donate, to WBUR. Does WBUR meet people’s needs in different ways? What makes them loyal to WBUR and consider themselves as a part of WBUR community? And given all this, what is the most effective way to drive them towards an altruism moment, where they donate to WBUR?

  <h1 class='center'>Define the Audience - <br>Creating research persona</h1></h1>
  <p class="text">
      There are 500,000 unique individuals listening to WBUR each week. How do we communicate effectively with each of them about why they listen to WBUR, what makes them loyal to the program, and what drives them to donate? Our answer is to use personas. A user persona is a fictional, yet realistic, description of a person who uses your product. In this case, someone who consumes WBUR’s content. By creating a set of representative personas, we are able to reduce our audience down to a <a href="https://uxplanet.org/ux-personas-vs-marketing-personas-whats-the-difference-adc77f630332">“manageable and memorable set of characters,”</a> and then design unique messages for each character in order to explore how to reach all our audience members.

    <h1 class="center">The Experiment</h1>
    <p>
        With three personas in hand, we designed an experiment to test the effectiveness of communicating to WBUR’s audience by persona. We wanted to determine two things with an experiment: know if the personas reflect unique populations in our listener audience and understand, if we communicated to users in the language and perspective of their persona, that they will engage more with us. As a reminder, the three personas are the Aspirational Learner, the World Citizen, and the Lifelong Listener which represent why someone listens to WBUR: either to get smarter, to track the news, or to feel an emotional connection.

        The structure of the experiment was to find users loyal to WBUR via Facebook Ads, ask them a question to have them self-select their persona, and then take them through a series of interactive messages explaining why they should donate. If everything worked perfectly, users who got the correct persona messaging would complete a donation.

      <p>
        By interviewing parents and children, I built three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)">personas</a> and concluded that parents care most about reliable and efficient AQI forecast and advices to protect their children, while children care most about their health and entertainment on smog days.

          To evaluate our donation personas, we ran ads on Facebook for three days pointing to our persona donation experiment. As outlined in our previous blog post, we wanted to determine two things with the experiment: if the personas reflect unique populations in our listener audience and, if we communicated to in the language and perspective of their personas, if listeners will engage more with us. From these ads, we had 406 participants in the experiment. Below is a summary of our discoveries and observations.

    <h2>Ideation: Eight Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      Based on the research insights, I started the design by sketching out different solutions, ranging from a mobile app to pervasive interactions such as smart mask.
      I came up with 8 approaches to help parents keep their children safe and entertained on smog days.

    <h2>Use Cases &amp; Contexts</h2>
    <p>
      To understand how users would use AirC, I tried to discover the stories of the primary persona of a busy father who wants to protect his child from the smog and at the same time keep the kid from being bored.
      I set up five stories settings and mapped them together to gain more insights:
    </p>

    <p class="center">
      <i>Story Mapping: User Activities and Tasks in Different Settings</i>
    </p> 
    <p>
      Based on the story mapping, I concluded that the most important features are accurate air quality forecast, interpretation of the air quality index, advices on how to protect children, and connecting devices to monitor home conditions.
      Therefore, I decided to go with a mobile application as it is the best way to synthesize these features together.

      The first iteration is rapid prototyping on paper.

        <ul>
          <li>The tips on dashboard are common-sense and not helpful enough</li>
          <li>Some icons are vague and might cause confusion</li>
          <li>The questions in the forum should be more organized</li>

    <p>
      The impact AirC aims to make is to inform parents the AQI and provide solutions to
      <b>protect children more effectively</b>.
      Currently, most parents in China do not know what to do in polluted days and some of their actions
      to protect their kids are useless or even wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to providing solutions,
      I hope that AirC will also help users know the seriousness of air pollution and inform them to
      <b>act actively to protect our living environment</b>!
