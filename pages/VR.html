    <h1 class='center'>Solution Overview</h1>
    <p class="text">
        <i>TexAR</i> is a dynamic texturing method which would use AR to enable instant dynamic texturing on the physical model by recognizing the structure and let architect choose different materials from a material library. The physical model would be an anchor that connects textures and physical model. Architects can hold the physical model in their hands, see effects applying materials they choose in real time with our system and have a good spatial understanding at the same time.

<i>TexAR</i> improves the communication accuracy and efficiency on architecture texturing, which enable the clients to get a deep understanding of the materials that will be applied on the model in the real world.

      <p>
            Designers are trained to solve problem by generating design solution from applying design thinking and methodologies. A huge part of education for future designers that students majoring in architecture, industrial design, user experience design, art...is design exercise, which provides problems for students to put what they have learned into practice. However, we identified in school setting, there is disconnection between the real world and academic training. See more about our <a href="mastery/proposal.pdf">Exploration</a>.</p>

        <h1 class="center">Design Challenge - <br>Share architecture students' design to a broder population</h1>
        <p class="text">
            Architecture students rely a lot on models for presenting their work to get feedback for design iteration. The physical model is convenient to get feedback as it is accessible to observe the design, while the Digital 3D model is faster to build and modify. Therefore, architecture students use both models to present their design. However, this presenting method limits students getting feedbacks from a broader community who are not in the same physical place with them. It’s important for students to have their designs reviewed and fully understood by more people, which is why a more convenient, sharing and online platform that could show an architecture design completely and immersively is necessary.

            This is an online platform where people share their architecture design. Project A has a profile which shows a 3D digital model that we could drag around to observe 360-degree view. You can click into any area of the model, then there will be VR video experiences providing the observation of the space. For example, click into project A’s bedroom area, you can choose one perspective from “Mother”, “Father” and “Baby”, and mark the space where you have a concern during the VR video experience. We created 2 draft VR video experience for project A: 1.Observe bedroom and balcony from a baby’s perspective. 2. Observe living room from a father’s perspective.
            If you are project A’s owner, you can choose to see all the other people’s concerns and comments about your design mapped on the 3D digital model. Every place other people marked or commented when they were in the VR video experience will show on the 3D digital model.

          To understand how users would use AirC, I tried to discover the stories of the primary persona of a busy father who wants to protect his child from the smog and at the same time keep the kid from being bored.
          I set up five stories settings and mapped them together to gain more insights:

          </h4>
        </div>
       
        <p>
          Based on the story mapping, I concluded that the most important features are accurate air quality forecast, interpretation of the air quality index, advices on how to protect children, and connecting devices to monitor home conditions.
          Therefore, I decided to go with a mobile application as it is the best way to synthesize these features together.
